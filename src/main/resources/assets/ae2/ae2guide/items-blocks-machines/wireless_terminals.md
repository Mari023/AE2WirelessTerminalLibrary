# Wireless Terminal

<ItemImage id="wireless_terminal" scale="4" />


Wireless terminals are portable versions of the regular wired [terminals](terminals.md). They have the exact same UIs as their
wired counterparts, except instead of slots for <ItemLink id="view_cell" />s, they have slots for [upgrade cards](upgrade_cards.md)

In order to pair them with a network, insert the terminal in the top-right slot of a <ItemLink id="wireless_access_point" />
connected to that network. (The slot with a picture of a wireless terminal on it and an arrow below it)

They must be within range of a <ItemLink id="wireless_access_point" /> to function.

Their energy can be recharged in a <ItemLink id="charger" />.
